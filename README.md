modern scroll is an extension for Opera and Chromium-based browsers that takes scrolling to a whole new level.

What's so awesome about it?

+ its scroll bars don't take up any space so the whole screen width can be used to display what a browser is made for: websites
+ elements or whole pages don't shift by some pixels when content changes and bars become (un)necessary
+ scroll bars are usable in fullscreen mode as well
+ scroll bars automatically hide when they are not needed
+ behavior and appearance is fully customizable
+ can boost your scrolling performance
+ scrolling speed and behavior is adjustable
+ unique "superbar" which makes it possible to scroll horizontally and vertically at the same time
+ buttons for scrolling to top and bottom of the page
+ Interface for custom mouse gestures / bookmarklets
